6. RealEstateDetailsDialog opens
7. User fills property-specific details
8. Details saved via POST /assets/:assetId/real-estate
9. Tables refresh showing updated data

### Creating New Gold Asset
1. User clicks "Add Gold" on GoldPage
2. AssetFormDialog opens with precious_metal category pre-selected
3. User fills base asset information (name, date, price, weight in grams)
4. Asset is created via POST /assets
5. User can then click gold details icon

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript
- **@tanstack/react-query** for data fetching and caching
- **Chakra UI v3** for components
- **react-hook-form** with **zod** for form validation
- **date-fns** for date formatting
- **React Router** for navigation

### Backend
- **Express.js** with TypeScript
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations
- **PostgreSQL** database
- JWT authentication

## API Endpoints Used

### Assets
- `GET /assets` - List all assets (filtered on frontend)
- `POST /assets` - Create new asset
- `PUT /assets/:id` - Update asset
- `GET /assets/categories` - List categories (for filtering)

### Real Estate
- `GET /assets/:assetId/real-estate` - Get property details
- `POST /assets/:assetId/real-estate` - Add property details
- `PUT /assets/:assetId/real-estate` - Update property details

### Gold
- `GET /assets/:assetId/gold` - Get gold details
- `POST /assets/:assetId/gold` - Add gold details
- `PUT /assets/:assetId/gold` - Update gold details

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Reusable AssetFormDialog**: Single component used by both Real Estate and Gold pages to avoid code duplication
2. **Auto-category Selection**: Category is pre-selected based on the page context (real_estate or precious_metal)
3. **Separate Detail Dialogs**: Property and gold details have their own specialized dialogs for better UX
4. **Client-side Filtering**: Asset filtering by category_type happens on frontend for performance
5. **Responsive Tables**: Custom ResponsiveTable component provides mobile-optimized views
6. **Optimistic UI Updates**: React Query handles cache invalidation after mutations
7. **Form Validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity before API calls
8. **Decimal Precision**: Gold weight supports 4 decimal places for accurate tracking

## Mobile Responsiveness

Both pages feature fully responsive designs:
- **Desktop**: Full table view with all columns
- **Mobile**: Card-based layout with expandable details
- **Tablets**: Adaptive grid layouts (2-column stats, responsive forms)

## Validation Rules

## Error Handling
