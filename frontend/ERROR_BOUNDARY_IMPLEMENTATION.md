# Error Boundary Implementation

## Overview

This application implements a comprehensive error boundary system to prevent individual route errors from crashing the entire application. The implementation includes multiple layers of error protection.

## Architecture

### 1. App-Level Error Boundary
Located in `App.tsx`, this is the outermost error boundary that catches any errors not handled by lower-level boundaries.

**File:** `src/App.tsx`
```tsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Router>
    <Box minH="100vh" bg="bg.canvas">
      <AppRoutes />
    </Box>
  </Router>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

### 2. Route-Level Error Boundary
Located in `AppLayout.tsx`, this wraps the `<Outlet />` component to catch errors in any rendered route without breaking the app layout.

**File:** `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
```tsx
<RouteErrorBoundary>
  <Outlet />
</RouteErrorBoundary>
```

### 3. Individual Route Error Boundaries
Each route element is wrapped with its own error boundary for granular error isolation.

**File:** `src/routes/index.tsx`
```tsx
<Route path="dashboard" element={<RouteElement><DashboardPage /></RouteElement>} />
```

## Components

### ErrorBoundary
**Location:** `src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

The main error boundary component used at the app level. When an error occurs:
- Shows a full-page error screen
- Displays error message
- Provides "Refresh Page" and "Go to Dashboard" buttons
- Redirects to dashboard on reset

**Use Case:** Catches catastrophic errors that affect the entire application.

### RouteErrorBoundary
**Location:** `src/components/common/RouteErrorBoundary.tsx`

A specialized error boundary for route-level errors. Features:
- Automatically resets when navigating to a different route
- Shows error within the app layout (keeps header/sidebar visible)
- Provides detailed error information in development mode
- Offers "Try Again" and "Go to Dashboard" buttons
- Includes helpful message that other pages still work

**Use Case:** Catches errors within individual routes without breaking the overall app structure.

## Error Boundary Hierarchy

```
App (ErrorBoundary)
  └── Router
      └── Routes
          └── AppLayout
              └── RouteErrorBoundary
                  └── Outlet
                      └── RouteElement (Individual Route)
                          └── Page Component
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Errors in one route don't crash the entire application
2. **User Experience**: Users can navigate to other routes even when one fails
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Error screens provide clear feedback and recovery options
4. **Development Feedback**: Detailed error information in development mode
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Error boundaries reset when navigating to different routes

## Testing Error Boundaries

### Using ErrorTestButton (Development Only)

A test component is provided to trigger errors for testing:

**Location:** `src/components/common/ErrorTestButton.tsx`

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { ErrorTestButton } from '../components/common/ErrorTestButton';

// Add to any component during development
<ErrorTestButton />
```

Clicking this button will throw a test error, allowing you to verify that error boundaries work correctly.

### Manual Testing

To test error boundaries manually:

1. **Throw an error in a component:**
```tsx
const TestComponent = () => {
  throw new Error('Test error');
  return <div>Content</div>;
};
```

2. **Trigger an error in useEffect:**
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  throw new Error('Effect error');
}, []);
```

3. **Trigger an error in an event handler:**
```tsx
const handleClick = () => {
  throw new Error('Event handler error');
};
```

**Note:** Event handler errors won't be caught by error boundaries by default. You need to wrap the handler logic in a try-catch and manually trigger a component error.

## Error Recovery

### Automatic Recovery
- **Route Navigation**: RouteErrorBoundary automatically resets when navigating to a different route
- **No Manual Intervention**: Users can simply click a navigation link to recover

### Manual Recovery
- **Try Again Button**: Resets the error boundary for the current route
- **Go to Dashboard Button**: Navigates to dashboard and resets error state
- **Refresh Page Button**: Performs a full page reload (app-level boundary)

## Best Practices

1. **Always Wrap Outlets**: Any component that renders `<Outlet />` should wrap it with `RouteErrorBoundary`

2. **Layer Error Boundaries**: Use multiple layers of error boundaries for better error isolation

3. **Provide Context**: Show helpful error messages that guide users to recovery

4. **Log Errors**: Error boundaries log errors to console for debugging:
```tsx
console.error('Route error:', error, errorInfo);
```

5. **Development vs Production**: Show detailed error information in development, user-friendly messages in production

6. **Test Regularly**: Use the ErrorTestButton or manual tests to verify error boundaries work

## Error Information

### In Development Mode
- Full error message
- Component stack trace
- Detailed error information panel

### In Production Mode
- User-friendly error message
- Error message (without stack trace)
- Recovery options

## Common Issues

### Issue: Error boundary doesn't catch error
**Possible Causes:**
- Error occurs in event handler (use try-catch)
- Error occurs in async code (use try-catch)
- Error boundary is not an ancestor of the failing component

### Issue: Error boundary doesn't reset
**Possible Causes:**
- Not using RouteErrorBoundary for route-level errors
- Need to navigate to different route
- Need to manually trigger reset

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the error boundary system:

1. **Error Reporting**: Integrate with error tracking services (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
2. **Error Analytics**: Track error frequency and patterns
3. **Partial Recovery**: Allow partial page rendering instead of full error screen
4. **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed operations
5. **Error Context**: Provide more context about what operation failed

## Conclusion

The multi-layered error boundary system provides robust error handling that prevents individual route failures from crashing the entire application. Users can always navigate away from errors, and the app remains usable even when individual components fail.
