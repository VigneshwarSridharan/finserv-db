# Holding Transactions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented expandable holding rows that display transaction history and allow adding new transactions.

## What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated Database View**
   - Added `holding_id`, `account_id`, and `security_id` to `v_security_holdings` view
   - Modified files:
     - `backend/src/db/schemas/views.schema.ts`
     - `schema/07_views.sql`
   - Created migration: `schema/migrations/add_holding_id_to_view.sql`

2. **View Fields Added**
   ```sql
   holding_id    -- Primary key from user_security_holdings table
   account_id    -- Foreign key needed for creating transactions
   security_id   -- Foreign key needed for creating transactions
   ```

### Frontend Changes

1. **API Service** (`frontend/src/api/services/securities.service.ts`)
   - Added `getTransactions(holdingId)` method to `holdingsService`

2. **Type Updates** (`frontend/src/types/domain.types.ts`)
   - Updated `SecurityHolding` interface with:
     - `holding_id: number`
     - `account_id: number`
     - `security_id: number`

3. **New Components**
   
   **AddTransactionDialog** (`frontend/src/features/securities/AddTransactionDialog.tsx`)
   - Form dialog for adding new transactions to a holding
   - Auto-calculates total_amount and net_amount
   - Form validation with zod
   - Fields: transaction_type, date, quantity, price, charges, notes
   - Pre-fills account_id and security_id from holding

   **HoldingTransactionsList** (`frontend/src/features/securities/HoldingTransactionsList.tsx`)
   - Displays transaction history for a specific holding
   - Responsive table showing date, type, quantity, price, amounts
   - "Add Transaction" button to open AddTransactionDialog
   - Empty state when no transactions exist
   - Mobile-friendly accordion view

4. **Enhanced ResponsiveTable** (`frontend/src/components/common/ResponsiveTable.tsx`)
   - Added expandable row functionality
   - New `expandableConfig` prop with:
     - `getExpandKey`: Function to get unique key for expansion
     - `expandedContent`: Content to render when row is expanded
   - Desktop: Expand/collapse icon button in first column
   - Mobile: Expandable content within accordion items

5. **Updated HoldingsPage** (`frontend/src/features/securities/HoldingsPage.tsx`)
   - Added `HoldingTransactionsList` import
   - Updated `SecurityHolding` interface with new fields
   - Configured `expandableConfig` on ResponsiveTable
   - Each row can now be expanded to show transaction history

## Key Features

### User Experience
- ✅ Click expand icon to view transactions for any holding
- ✅ See complete transaction history (buys, sells, bonuses, etc.)
- ✅ Add new transactions directly from the holding view
- ✅ Auto-calculation of transaction amounts
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Proper React Query cache invalidation

### Technical Features
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Form validation with Zod schemas
- ✅ Optimistic updates with React Query
- ✅ Consistent UI patterns with Chakra UI v3
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Reusable components for future features

## Required Setup Steps

### 1. Database Migration (CRITICAL)

Run the migration to update the database view:

```bash
# Option 1: Using psql
psql -U your_username -d finserv_db -f schema/migrations/add_holding_id_to_view.sql

# Option 2: Direct SQL
# Connect to your database and run:
```

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_security_holdings;

CREATE VIEW v_security_holdings AS
SELECT 
    ush.holding_id,
    ush.user_id,
    ush.account_id,
    ush.security_id,
    u.first_name || ' ' || u.last_name as user_name,
    b.broker_name,
    uba.account_number,
    s.symbol,
    s.name as security_name,
    s.security_type,
    s.exchange,
    s.sector,
    ush.quantity,
    ush.average_price,
    ush.current_price,
    ush.total_investment,
    ush.current_value,
    ush.unrealized_pnl,
    CASE 
        WHEN ush.average_price > 0 THEN 
            ROUND(((ush.current_price - ush.average_price) / ush.average_price) * 100, 2)
        ELSE 0 
    END as return_percentage,
    ush.first_purchase_date,
    ush.last_purchase_date
FROM user_security_holdings ush
JOIN users u ON ush.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN user_broker_accounts uba ON ush.account_id = uba.account_id
JOIN brokers b ON uba.broker_id = b.broker_id
JOIN securities s ON ush.security_id = s.security_id
WHERE u.is_active = TRUE AND s.is_active = TRUE;
```

### 2. Restart Backend Server

After running the migration:
```bash
cd backend
yarn dev
```

### 3. Verify Backend API

Test that the holdings API returns the new fields:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/holdings/securities
```

Expected response should include: `holding_id`, `account_id`, `security_id`

### 4. Start/Restart Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn dev
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration completed successfully
- [ ] Backend returns `holding_id`, `account_id`, `security_id` in holdings API
- [ ] Holdings page loads without errors
- [ ] Expand icon appears in holdings table
- [ ] Clicking expand icon shows transaction list
- [ ] Transaction list displays correctly (or shows empty state)
- [ ] "Add Transaction" button opens dialog
- [ ] Transaction form validates inputs
- [ ] Total amount and net amount auto-calculate
- [ ] Submitting form creates transaction
- [ ] Holdings update after adding transaction
- [ ] Mobile view works correctly with expanded rows

## Architecture

```
HoldingsPage
  └─ ResponsiveTable (with expandableConfig)
       └─ [Expanded Row Content]
            └─ HoldingTransactionsList
                 ├─ Transaction Table
                 └─ AddTransactionDialog (when "Add" clicked)
                      └─ Transaction Form
```

## Files Changed

### Backend
- `backend/src/db/schemas/views.schema.ts` - Updated view definition
- `schema/07_views.sql` - Updated SQL view
- `schema/migrations/add_holding_id_to_view.sql` - New migration file

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/api/services/securities.service.ts` - Added getTransactions
- `frontend/src/types/domain.types.ts` - Updated SecurityHolding interface
- `frontend/src/components/common/ResponsiveTable.tsx` - Added expandable support
- `frontend/src/features/securities/HoldingsPage.tsx` - Added expandable config
- `frontend/src/features/securities/HoldingTransactionsList.tsx` - New component
- `frontend/src/features/securities/AddTransactionDialog.tsx` - New component

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

1. Add edit/delete functionality for transactions
2. Add filtering options in transaction list (by type, date range)
3. Add pagination for holdings with many transactions
4. Add transaction summary metrics (total buys, sells, P&L)
5. Export transaction history to CSV
6. Bulk transaction upload from CSV/Excel

## Troubleshooting

### "holding_id is undefined" error
- Ensure database migration was run successfully
- Restart backend server after migration
- Check API response includes holding_id field

### Transactions not showing
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify `/holdings/securities/:id/transactions` endpoint works
- Ensure holding has transactions in database

### Form validation errors
- All required fields must be filled
- Quantity and price must be positive numbers
- Date must be in valid format

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check backend logs for API errors
3. Verify database migration completed
4. Ensure all services are running (database, backend, frontend)
